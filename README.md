# Aviation Accident Analysis
Provide a short discussion on your findings for your summary statistics and plots
    Recommendations: 
    - I would say that for small planes, they have to choose makes with lowest destruction rates and lowest serious/fatal injury fractions. They have a stronger safety performance. 
    - For large planes, major commercial makes with a low destruction rate are safer. 
    - Makes that do well on both injury fraction and destruction fraction are the best options to go with.

    Comments:
    - Large planes usually have low injury rates and destruction fractions.
    - Small planes have more variability in injury rates compared to large planes.
    - The serious/fatal injury fraction metric showed us that makes with lower fractions had incidents that were generally more survivable. This, with the mean destruction rates showed us which manufacturers tend to have less severe outcomes after an accident.

Discussion of Specific Airplane Types
    Small planes:
    - The top 10 safest small makes have very low serious/fatal injury fractions.
    - Most small planes rarely have serious accidents, but a few models have wider variation.
    - I recommend small planes from the top 10 makes that have consistently low injury fractions. 

    Large planes: 
    - Large airplane models have more consistent distributions, but some models still have higher injury fractions.
    - Models with at least 10 accidents have a more reliable estimate of safety.
    - I recommend large airplane models with both low mean serious/fatal fractions and low variation.

Exploring other variables
    Weather Conditions:
    - Flights that travel in clear weather(VMC) usually have lower serious/fatal injury fractions
    - Poor weather(IMC) conditions like fog or storms increase the chances of serious injuries and destroyed crafts
    - Most accidents happen in clear weather, likely because most flights occur in clear weather. 

    Phase of Flight:
    - Mean serious/fatal injury fraction is low for the “Landing” phase because most accidents during landing are survivable, and fatalities are usually less frequent compared to other phases (like “Takeoff” or “En Route”)
    - Ground and Taxi phases usually lowest injury rates.
    - Takeoff and Initial climb have higher mean serious/fatal rates because accidents here can be more catastrophic.
